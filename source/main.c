* Description: This example project demonstrates SPI communication between two
* SCB blocks of PSoC 6 device (one configured as Master and another as slave).
* Polling method is used on the master side to confirm data transfer completion.

* Function Name: main
*******************************************************************************
*
* Summary: 	1. 	Sets up two SPI blocks - one as master and another as slave
*   		2. 	SPI master sends commands to the slave to turn LED ON or OFF,
*   			every one second.
*   		3. 	SPI master polls for the data transfer completion.
*   		4.  When the required number of	bytes is transferred, data received
*   			by the slave is checked and LED is turned ON or OFF based on the
*   			received command.
*
* Parameters:	None
*
* Return:		Int
